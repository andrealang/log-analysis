# Managing your data in _service-name_
{: #delete-data}
<!-- The title of your H1 should be Managing your data in _service-name_, where _service-name_ is the non-trademarked short version conref. Include your service name as a search keyword at the top of your Markdown file. See the example keywords above. -->

_The short description should be a single, concise paragraph that contains one or two sentences and no more than 50 words. Summarize your offering's processes for handling and deleting data._
{: shortdesc}

<!-- Work with your offering's SMEs to fill out the following sections as applicable to your offering. -->

## How your data is stored
{: #data-storage}

_Document how your offering stores user data as it relates to user activities._

_Do not include any details that would give malicious persons an advantage to compromising your offering environment._

## Deleting your data
{: #data-delete}

_Document how users can delete their data within the service._

_If applicable, add H3s in this section to tailor the information to particular types of data. For example, you might have a "Deleting keys" section and a "Deleting a database" section._


### Deleting the service

_Include information about whether deleting the service fully erases all data. If deleting the service doesn't remove all personal data, include information about how users can completely delete their data._

<!-- Information about how long services keep data after instances are deleted is covered in the service description. Include the following reference for users to find their data retention period. -->

The _service-name_ data retention policy describes how long your data is stored after you delete the service. The data retention policy is included in the _service-name_ service description, which you can find in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Terms and Notices](/docs/overview?topic=overview-terms).

## Restoring deleted data
{: #data-restore}

_If users can restore deleted data within your service, include this optional section and the task that users can complete to do so._

_Important: Don't include information about restoring your resource via the reclamation controller because it's available only on a limited basis._
