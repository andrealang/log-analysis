# Getting started with IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA
{: #getting-started}

Use IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA to add log management capabilities to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} architecture. IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA is operated by LogDNA in partnership with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}


## Step 1: Before you begin
{: #prereqs}

* Read about IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA. For more information, see [About IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/overview.html#about).
* Check the regions where the service is available. For more information, see [Regions](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/overview.html#regions).
* Get a user ID that is a member or an owner of an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. 

    To get an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user ID, go to: [Registration ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/){:new_window}.



## Step 2: Get started
{: #getstarted}

Choose a cloud resource for which you want to manage logs. Then, configure this log source so that you can monitor its logs through the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service. The log source can be located in the same region where you provision an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance or in a different region.

The following table lists cloud resources that you can configure to store and manage logs by using the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service. Complete the tutorial for a resource to get started working with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service:

<table>

  <tr>
    <th>Resource</th>
    <th>Tutorial</th>
    <th>Environment</th>
    <th>Scenario</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>![Ubuntu server and the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA](images/ubuntu.png "Ubuntu server and the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA")</td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Step 3: Upgrade the plan
{: #upgrade}

Enable additional logging features.

Upgrade the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service plan to a paid plan to be able to [filter logs](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/view_logs.html#step5), [search logs](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/view_logs.html#step6), [define views](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/view_logs.html#step7), and [configure alerts](https://docs.logdna.com/docs/alerts). . For more information about IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service plans, see [Pricing plans](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/overview.html#pricing_plans).

## Step 4: Manage user access with IAM
{: #iam}

Identify the IAM policies that a user needs to work with the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service.

To learn more about IAM integration with the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service, see [Managing user access with IAM](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/iam.html#iam).

For example, learn how to grant permissions to a user to work with the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service:

| User role in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} | For more information                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Account owner                                       | [Granting permissions to a user to become an administrator of the service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#admin_account) |
| Platform service administrator in the account       | [Granting permissions to a user to become an administrator of the service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#admin_account) |
| Platform service administrator in a resource group  | [Granting permissions to a user to become an administrator of the service within a resource group](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#admin_rg) |
| Platform Devops operator in the account           | [Granting permissions to a Devops user to manage the service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#devops_account) |
| Platform Devops operator in a resource group        | [Granting permissions to a Devops user to manage the service within a resource group](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#devops_rg) |
| Service administrator in LogDNA                     | [Granting permissions to manage logs and configure alerts in LogDNA](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#admin_user_logdna)              |
| User / developer                                    | [Granting permissions to a user to view and manage logs in LogDNA](/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA/work_iam.html#user_logdna)               |
