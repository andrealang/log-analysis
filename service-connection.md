# Securing your connection
{: #service-connection}

To ensure that you have enhanced control and security over your data when you use {{site.data.keyword.la_full}}, you have the option of using private routes to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoints. Private routes are not accessible or reachable over the internet. By using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private service endpoints feature, you can protect your data from threats from the public network and logically extend your private network.
{: shortdesc}


## Before you begin
{: #prereq-service-endpoint}

Some factors that you must consider when you must decide which network to choose are:
* Corporate requirements on how services and applications can access cloud-based services in your account
* Security on production workloads
* Industry compliance regulations

For example, you might have the following requirements when you are working in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}:
* No access to Internet to connect to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services
* Isolated connectivity for workloads in your account

When you have these requirements, you should move from the public network to the private network.

You can configure a LogDNA agent to connect to an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance through the public network or through the private network. By default, the agent connects through the public network.
{: note}

The type of network defines the level of isolation and security that is configured to move workloads between cloud-based resources in your account. Consider connecting the LogDNA agent over the private network.
{: tip}


## Setting up private service endpoints for {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}
{: #endpoint-setup}

Private network endpoints support routing services over the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network instead of the public network. 

* A private network endpoint provides a unique IP address that is accessible to you without a VPN connection.
* Private endpoints work between regions offering a global network. You can run your applications and services in Dallas, and connect to a LogDNA instance in Sydney with a private endpoint.



### Step 1: Enabling your account
{: #endpoint-setup-step1}

To use private network endpoints, the following account features must be enabled for your account:
* Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)
* Service endpoints

    Enabling service endpoints means that all users in the account can connect to private network endpoints.
    {: note}

You must first enable virtual routing and forwarding in your account, and then you can enable the use of IBM Cloud private service endpoints. 
* To enable VRF, you create a support case. 
* To enable service endpoints, you use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. For more information about how to enable your account, see [Enabling VRF and service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint).


### Step 2: Setting a private endpoint
{: #endpoint-setup-step2}

After your account is enabled for VRF and service endpoints, you can configure a LogDNA agent to connect to an {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance through the private network. 

A service instance can have a private network endpoint, a public network endpoint, or both.
* Public network endpoint: A service endpoint on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public network.
* Private network endpoint: A service endpoint that is accessible only on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network with no access from the public internet.
* Both public and private network endpoints: Service endpoints that allow access over both networks.

The {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service offers the following private endpoints:


| Region                   | Private Endpoint                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Dallas (us-south)`      | `https://api.private.us-south.logging.cloud.ibm.com`   |
| `Frankfurt (eu-de)`      | `https://api.private.eu-de.logging.cloud.ibm.com`      |
| `London (eu-gb)`         | `https://api.private.eu-gb.logging.cloud.ibm.com`      |
| `Tokyo (jp-tok)`         | `https://api.private.jp-tok.logging.cloud.ibm.com`     |
| `Seoul (kr-seo)`         | `https://api.private.kr-seo.logging.cloud.ibm.com`     |
| `Sydney (au-syd)`        | `https://api.private.au-syd.logging.cloud.ibm.com`     |
| `Washington (us-east)`   | `https://api.private.us-east.logging.cloud.ibm.com`     |

### Step 3: Configure your LogDNA agent
{: #endpoint-setup-step3}

You can [configure the LogDNA agent](/docs/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-logdna_agent) to use the private network by using a private endpoint as the ingestion URL.

What happens when you configure the LogDNA agent to use a private endpoint?
* Private endpoints are not accessible from the public internet. 
* All traffic is routed to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. 
* Services like {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} are no longer served on an internet routable IP address.




## Limitations using private endpoints
{: #network_endpoints_limitations}

Consider the following limitations:
* Ingestion endpoints of type `syslog-tcp (syslog-a)` and `syslog-udp (syslog-u)` are not currently supported on the Cloud Service Endpoint (CSE) network.Â 
* The LogDNA web UI is not currently supported on the private network.



## Allowing outgoing network traffic
{: #network_outgoing_traffic}

When you have an additional firewall set up, or you have customized the firewall settings in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure, you need to allow outgoing network traffic to the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service. 

You must allow outgoing traffic on TCP port 443 and TCP port 80 in your firewall. For example, you must open TCP port 443 and TCP port 80 from each worker to the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service.

The API endpoint is required for LogDNA agent authentication. The LogDNA agent gets a token that you can use to send logs to the ingestion endpoint.

If you configure the LogDNA agent to connect to the logging instance through the **private network**, open a support ticket to request the private IP addresses that you must enable in your firewall. For information about opening an IBM support ticket, see [Getting support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#getting-customer-support).
