# Removing an instance
{: #remove}

You can remove an instance of the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA service from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} UI or through the command line.
{:shortdesc}

When you remove an instance from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, consider the following information to tidy up:

1. Write down the list of sources that forward metrics to the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance that you want to remove. You must remove the LogDNA agent from each source.
2. Remove permissions granted to users to work with the instance. 

    If you use an access group to manage access to the instance, you must remove the access group.

    If you use an access group to manage access to different service instances, you must remove the policies that grant permissions to the instance that you want to remove.
    
    If you have granted individual policies to users, you must gather the information of each user that has access, and remove one by one the policies that relate to the instance that you want to delete.


Then, delete the instance from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard.
