## Overview
{: #ov}

To add logging features with LogDNA in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you must provision an instance of IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA.

Before you provision an instance of IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA, consider the following information:

* You must accept the terms and conditions that specify that your data is sent to a third party.
* Your users must have platform permissions to create, view, and delete an instance of a service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
* Your users must have platform permissions to create resources within the context of the resource group where you plan to provision the LogDNA instance.

You provision an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance within the context of a resource group. A resource group lets you organize your services for access control and billing purposes. You can provision the instance in the *default* resource group or in a custom resource group.

After you provision an instance of IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA, an account in created in LogDNA, and you receive the ingestion key for your account.

Then, you must configure a LogDNA agent for each log source. A log source is a cloud resource that generates logs. For example, a log source can be a Kubernetes cluster. You use the ingestion key to configure the LogDNA agent that is responsible for collecting and forwarding logs to your LogDNA instance.

After the LogDNA agent is deployed in a log source, collection and forwarding of logs to the LogDNA instance is automatic.

You can launch the LogDNA Web UI to view, monitor, and manage your logs.

The following figure shows the components overview for the LogDNA service that is running on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}:

## Log data
{: #data}

IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA collects and aggregates logs in one centralized logging system.

* Log data is hosted on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
* Data is colocated in the region where the IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance is provisioned. For example, log data for an instance provisioned in US South is hosted in the US South region.

The service plan that you choose for an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance defines the number of days that data is stored and retained in LogDNA. For example, if you choose the *Free* plan, data is not stored at all. However, if you choose the 7 day plan, data is stored for 7 days and you have access to it through the LogDNA Web UI.

When you delete an instance of IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}, all the data is deleted.
